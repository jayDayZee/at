@ only exists in runtime
@ is a tip of the hat to "a" (granddaddy to c), but in a circle.

the concept of source code is a tip of the hat to the material (paper, stone) languages that have formed the basis for cross generational language. Cross generational language is the first tool that distantly out paced genetic evolution as a tool for change. This is why it should be tipped a hat to.

Source code is not required to define formal systems (software)

Software is the invention of Jon Von Neuman.
Before von Neuman, computers were "programmed" by connecting switches with patch cables (guitar cables)
Alexander Turing and Jon von Neuman are brothers in futures.
Jon von Neuman designed the modern micro processor.
Jon von Neuman invented the idea that if you implement a single Turing complete machine
